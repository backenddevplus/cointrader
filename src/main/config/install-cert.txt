BTC-e is currently using an invalid, revoked certificate (saved as btc-e.cer).  To connect to BTC-e we need to add
this certificate to Java's trust store.

cd $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security
sudo ../../bin/keytool -import -alias ca -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit -file /path/to/trader/src/main/config/btc-e.cer
